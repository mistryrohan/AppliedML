Since taking CSC311, learning about other ML concepts, and seeing how the industry is changing, I always wanted to spend some time actually coding things that are mostly ML related. In this repository I'll just be adding what I've spend my time learning, starting with refreshers on NumPy and Pandas, then learning the basics of PyTorch. The goal is to just keep learning things and hopefully apply some of these concepts into some future projects or at work. After graduation I want to spend more time taking courses related to this just to get a better understanding and staying up to date with this ever evolving field.
